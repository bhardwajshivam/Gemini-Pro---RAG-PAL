## GeminiPro - RAG,PAL

Gemini-Pro is a project focused on utilizing the multimodal functionality of Gemini Pro. This involves working with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and PAL (Prompt Augmented Language model) through the Langchain framework.

### Overview:
Gemini-Pro aims to harness the multimodal capabilities of Gemini Pro, a cutting-edge platform for natural language processing tasks. Specifically, it explores the integration of RAG and PAL models using the Langchain framework.

### Installation:
To install the required dependencies for Gemini-Pro, run the following commands:

```bash
!pip -q install langchain_experimental langchain_core
!pip -q install google-generativeai==0.3.1
!pip -q install google-ai-generativelanguage==0.4.0
!pip -q install langchain-google-genai
!pip -q install "langchain[docarray]"
```

### Components:
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: RAG is a model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to natural language processing tasks. It leverages external knowledge sources to enhance text generation.
- **PAL (Prompt Augmented Language model)**: PAL is a language model that utilizes prompts to guide the generation process. It allows for fine-tuning and customization of generated outputs based on specific prompts.

### Usage:
1. **Integration with Gemini Pro**: Utilize Gemini-Pro to access the multimodal functionality of Gemini Pro.
2. **Exploring RAG and PAL**: Experiment with RAG and PAL models to understand their capabilities and potential applications.
3. **Langchain Framework**: Leverage the Langchain framework for seamless integration and interaction with RAG and PAL models.
